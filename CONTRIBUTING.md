# Contributing

Turjuman is free for the ummah and open source (MIT). Fixes, translations of the interface and
new languages are all welcome.

## Getting started

You need Node.js 24 and pnpm 12. ffmpeg is only needed for server-side audio capture and file
replay.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build            # server, app and website
pnpm test             # unit tests (offline)
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint             # Biome; `pnpm exec biome check --write .` fixes formatting
```

Run the server without spending money: `turjuman replay <provider.jsonl>` replays a recorded
session with no network calls.

## Docker: tests, development mode and the image

- `make test`: typecheck, lint and unit/integration tests in the `build` stage with
  `network_mode: none`, proving the non-live tests need no network. It always rebuilds the
  test image first.
- `make e2e`: starts a `replay` service from the app image (FakeProvider replaying
  `test/fixtures/${E2E_FIXTURE:-soniox-tts-1}.jsonl --speed 1 --loop`, throwaway tmpfs
  config/data; an optional `test/fixtures/e2e/config.yaml` becomes its config) and the pinned
  `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble` container, which installs
  `playwright-core@1.63.0` inside the container and runs
  `node --experimental-strip-types test/e2e/run.ts` with the repo mounted at `/work`. The
  Playwright container shares the replay container's network namespace, so:
  - `E2E_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765`: a secure context, so `getUserMedia` (fake mic) works;
  - `E2E_INSECURE_URL=http://replay:8765`: the same server on a non-loopback origin, for the
    "HTTPS needed" banner test;
  - `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL` is unset: the image's bundled Chromium is used.

  It does not touch the running service (no published ports, separate image tag).
- `make dev`: stops the service (same ports), then runs `pnpm dev` (tsx watch + web watch)
  with `src/`, `web/`, `scripts/`, `config/` and `data/` mounted, as the `node` user. When you
  leave it, start the service again with `make up`. On Windows, file watching across the Docker
  Desktop mount can be slow; dev mode is mainly for Linux and macOS.
- `make replay LOG=<path inside data/>`: stops the service, replays a provider log on the same
  ports for overlay work, and restarts the service afterwards (also on Ctrl-C).

**Bumping the Node base image.** The Dockerfile pins `node:24-slim` by its multi-arch **index**
digest, so the same pin works on amd64 and arm64:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect node:24-slim     # copy the top-level "Digest:" (the index), not a per-platform one
# edit ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:24-slim@sha256:<digest> in Dockerfile
make build && make test && make restart
```

Pinned versions to bump the same way, deliberately: `pnpm` (`ARG PNPM_VERSION`, equal to
`packageManager` in package.json), and in `compose.yaml`
`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble` (equal to the `playwright-core` version in
compose.yaml and package.json). In the Dockerfile, tini is PID 1, so compose does not set
`init: true` for the service.

**Multi-arch build (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64).** The default `docker` builder cannot build
several platforms at once; use a `docker-container` builder:

```bash
docker buildx create --name turjuman-multi --driver docker-container --bootstrap   # once
docker buildx build --builder turjuman-multi --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t turjuman:multi .
# add --push -t <registry>/turjuman:<tag> to publish both architectures
```

Without `--push` the result stays in the build cache, which is enough to prove both
architectures build.

## Before you open a pull request

- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` pass.
- The offline smoke tests still pass for the part you changed:
  - `scripts/smoke-screens.ts` (accounts, screens, screen links);
  - `scripts/smoke-hosted.ts` (organisations and their keys);
  - `scripts/smoke-session.ts` (sessions);
  - `scripts/smoke-fast-blocks.ts` (caption blocks);
  - `scripts/eval-honorifics.ts` (Islamic terms).

  Run each with `pnpm exec tsx <script>`.
- **Tests never call Soniox.** Use the fakes in the smoke scripts or a recorded
  `provider.jsonl`. Live runs cost money and belong in a manual check.
- **No secrets anywhere:** no API keys, tokens or passwords in code, tests, fixtures, logs or
  commit messages.

## How the code is written

- TypeScript strict mode, ESM, no `any`. Small modules with one clear job.
- A comment explains *why*, in plain words; the code says *what*.
- **Browser pages:**
  - no inline scripts or styles (the Content-Security-Policy forbids them);
  - no CDNs (the pages work offline);
  - the app has no dark mode.
- **Design:** colours, type and radii come from the tokens in `web/shared/brand.css`.
- **Interface text:** keep it short. Every string exists in English, Dutch and Arabic
  (`web/shared/app-i18n.ts`, `site/content/`); Arabic layouts are right-to-left.

## Religious content

- **Quran text** is shown exactly as published by Tanzil: never edit, normalise or re-type it.
  Its licence and the translations' non-commercial terms are in `NOTICE`.
- **Translations of khutbahs:** changes that affect them (glossaries, honorifics) need
  a regression case in `scripts/eval-honorifics.ts`. Allah is never translated as "God".
